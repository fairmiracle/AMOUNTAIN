	abstract = {Searching for active connected subgraphs in biological networks has shown important to identifying functional modules. Most existing active modules identification methods need both network structural information and gene activity measures, typically requiring prior knowledge database and high-throughput data. As a pure data-driven gene network, weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN) could be constructed only from expression profile. Searching for modules on WGCN thus has potential values. While traditional clustering based modules detection on WGCN method covers all genes, unavoidable introducing many uninformative ones when annotating modules. We need to find more accurate part of them.},
